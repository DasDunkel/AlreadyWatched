# AlreadyWatched

A Google Chrome extension that allows users to mark a YouTube video as already watched in a single keybind, instead of 5 clicks.


# Issues

If you have issues getting this extension to work, please let me know. There might be differences depending on how fast/slow your computer is.

The code currently takes a pretty slow step that I could potentially fix that should make this issue go away and make the extension faster and more importantly more reliable.

There might still be remnants of NotInterested! in the code or icons, these will eventually be replaced.

# Acknowledgments

This code is borrowed from another chrome extension (NotInterested!) and modified for my personal liking. A link to that extension: http://notinterested.makestuffstudio.com.au
